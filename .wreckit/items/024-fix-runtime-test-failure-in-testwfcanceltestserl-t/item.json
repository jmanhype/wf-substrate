  "title": "Fix runtime test failure in test/wf_cancel_tests.erl — the test generator is_cancelled_active_scope_test_/0 crashes with ets:lookup/2 badarg. The wf_state module likely requires ETS table initialization before use. Fix the test setup to properly initialize the wf_state ETS tables, or mock them. Also check other test generators in wf_cancel_tests for the same issue. After fixing, rebar3 eunit must show 0 failures and 0 cancelled.",
