  "overview": "Implement wf_sched.erl: pluggable scheduler policies for the executor. The scheduler decides which enabled action to execute next when multiple are available (e.g., multiple parallel branches ready, multiple XOR choices available).\n\nThree policies:\n1. Deterministic: stable ordering of enabled actions (sorted by label/ID). Given the same set of enabled actions, always picks the same one. Useful for testing and reproducibility.\n2. Nondeterministic: random selection among enabled actions with recorded choices. Every choice is logged as {step_seq, enabled_set, chosen} for later replay. Uses rand module with configurable seed.\n3. Replay: feed a recorded choice log, reproduce the exact execution trace. On each decision point, consumes the next recorded choice. Fails loudly if the enabled set doesn't match the recording (divergence detection).\n\nThe scheduler is a behaviour with callback choose/2 :: (EnabledActions, SchedState) -> {Chosen, NewSchedState}. Each policy is a module implementing this behaviour.\n\nExport: new/2 (policy, options), choose/2, get_log/1, from_log/1 (create replay scheduler from recorded log).",
