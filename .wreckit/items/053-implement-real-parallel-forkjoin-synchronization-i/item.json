  "title": "Implement real parallel fork/join synchronization in wf_exec. Currently par_fork creates branch entries but join_wait never resolves because the scheduler returns mock tokens and branch completion is not tracked. Fix the executor so that: (1) par_fork spawns tokens for each branch and executes them, (2) each branch token runs to its done opcode, (3) join_wait with policy all blocks until all branches have completed, (4) after join, execution continues at the next opcode. The scheduler must select real active tokens not mock_token. ACCEPTANCE TEST in test/wf_acceptance_tests.erl: Compile wf_term:par([wf_term:task(x, #{function => fun(Ctx) -> {ok, Ctx#{x_ran => true}} end}), wf_term:task(y, #{function => fun(Ctx) -> {ok, Ctx#{y_ran => true}} end})]). Execute it with wf_exec:run/3. Assert it returns {done, FinalState} (NOT {yield, _}). Assert final context contains x_ran and y_ran. Do NOT use mocks.",
