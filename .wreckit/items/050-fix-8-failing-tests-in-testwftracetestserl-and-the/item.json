  "title": "Fix 8 failing tests in test/wf_trace_tests.erl and the 5 cancelled tests. The root cause is wf_trace:new/1 creates a named ETS table wf_trace_events — when multiple tests call new/1, the second call crashes with badarg (table already exists). Fix wf_trace:new/1 to delete existing table first or use ets:whereis to check. Also fix assertion mismatches in trace_level_full_test, sink_ets_test, snapshot_serialization_test, restore_bytecode_mismatch_test, restore_invalid_binary_test, filter_scope_test, filter_predicate_test, integration_wf_exec_emits_events_test.
