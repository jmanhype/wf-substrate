  "overview": "Implement example modules demonstrating real workflow patterns:\n\n1. wf_example_basic.erl — Vending machine workflow: seq(task(insert_coin), xor([seq(task(select_drink), task(dispense)), task(refund)])). Demonstrates basic sequence, exclusive choice with signal. Includes run/0 that executes with mock effects and prints trace.\n\n2. wf_example_discriminator.erl — Discriminator pattern: par of 3 approval tasks, first-complete join cancels remaining. Demonstrates parallel split, discriminator join, automatic cancellation. Simulates varying completion times via effect delays.\n\n3. wf_example_cancel_region.erl — Cancel region workflow: main flow with a cancel region containing a long-running subprocess. External signal triggers region cancellation mid-execution. Demonstrates structured cancellation preserving the main flow.\n\n4. wf_example_multiple_instances.erl — Multiple instance workflow: dynamic instance count (from ctx), each instance processes an item, wait_n join (3 of 5 must succeed). Demonstrates MI spawning, partial completion, cancellation of excess instances.\n\nEach example module exports:\n- term/0 -> wf_term() — the workflow definition.\n- run/0 -> {ok, Trace} — execute with mock effects, return trace.\n- expected_trace_structure/0 -> [atom()] — expected sequence of opcode categories for validation.\n\nInclude wf_test_examples.erl with EUnit tests asserting that each example's actual trace matches its expected_trace_structure.",
