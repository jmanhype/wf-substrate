  "overview": "Implement comprehensive test suites using EUnit (no external test dependencies):\n\n- wf_test_term.erl: test AST constructors and smart constructors. Verify type specs, structural validation (well_formed/1 accepts valid terms, rejects invalid), derived patterns produce expected term structures.\n- wf_test_seq.erl: test sequential composition. Single sequence, nested sequences, sequence with effects, sequence with cancellation mid-way.\n- wf_test_par.erl: test parallel split and synchronization. Par with 2/3/N branches, all branches complete, par with mixed completion times, par feeding into synchronizing merge.\n- wf_test_xor.erl: test exclusive choice and simple merge. XOR with 2/3/N branches, signal selects correct branch, unselected branches are disabled, simple merge converges correctly.\n- wf_test_join.erl: test all join policies. wait_all (all must complete), wait_n (N of M complete then cancel rest), first_complete (discriminator \u2014 first done cancels others). Verify join counter mechanics.\n- wf_test_cancel.erl: test activity/case/region cancellation. Cancel running task, cancel case with active branches, cancel region preserves unrelated scopes, cancel with pending effects.\n- wf_test_mi.erl: test multiple instance patterns. Fixed count, dynamic count, MI with wait_all, MI with wait_n, MI with first_complete, MI cancellation of remaining instances.\n\nMinimal property-based testing framework (no PropEr dependency): implement a simple random term generator (random_term/1 with depth limit) and invariant checkers. Properties: any generated term passes well_formed/1, any well-formed term compiles without error, compiled bytecode has no unresolved labels, execution of any compiled term terminates within bounded steps.",
