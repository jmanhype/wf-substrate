# wf_substrate Documentation

This directory will contain documentation for the wf_substrate workflow pattern substrate.

## Planned Documentation Files

The following documentation files will be added in future items:

- **ARCHITECTURE.md** - System architecture, module structure, and supervision tree design
- **SEMANTICS.md** - Workflow language semantics, execution model, and formal properties
- **PATTERNS.md** - Common workflow patterns and usage examples
- **TESTING.md** - Testing strategy, test organization, and quality assurance procedures
- **OPERATIONS.md** - Operational concerns: deployment, monitoring, logging, and debugging

## Source of Truth

Until these documents are created, the project specification in [`PROMPT.md`](../PROMPT.md) serves as the authoritative source for all architectural and semantic requirements.

## Documentation Status

See the project's Wreckit workflow for documentation implementation items.
